## Abstract
In this experiment,polyethersulfone (PES) was used as the solute and $\mathrm{N},\mathrm{N}$ - dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent. Two ultrafiltration membranes with different concentrations (10 wt% and 15 wt%) were prepared by the phase inversion method (immersion precipitation method). The pure water flux test was carried out on the two ultrafiltration membranes at room temperature and ${100}\mathrm{{kPa}}$ . The results show that compared with the 15 wt% PES film (Flux: ${0.10256}\mathrm{\;L} \cdot  {m}^{-2} \cdot  {ba}{r}^{-1}$ ),the 10 wt% sample has a larger pure water flux value (Sample A1: ${200.07}\mathrm{\;L} \cdot  {m}^{-2} \cdot  {ba}{r}^{-1}$ ; A2: ${35.75}\mathrm{\;L} \cdot  {m}^{-2} \cdot  {ba}{r}^{-1}$ ). Among them,the surface finish of the film has a greater impact on the pure water flux. Although the surface of the A2 sample has only a few wrinkles, compared with the smooth A1, the flux is less than 18%. In actual applications to remove dye contaminants in books, A can be better used directly, while B has higher potential.

## Introduction
Membrane technology plays an important role in wastewater treatment systems due to its advantages such as small footprint, low chemical consumption, and environmental friendliness (Vatsha et al., 2014). Ultrafiltration (UF), as a typical membrane separation process, is widely used in separation applications in water treatment, food, papermaking, textile and biochemical industries (Asatekin et al., 2007). Polyethersulfone (PES) polymer is widely used in the preparation of UF membranes due to its good chemical resistance, good thermal stability, wide pH tolerance, suitable chlorine tolerance, and ease of fabrication (Xu & Alsalhy Qusay, 2004).

The non-solvent induced phase separation method used in this experiment is a commonly used method for preparing polymer membranes (Guillen et al., 2011). The structure of the prepared membrane is mainly controlled by the phase behavior of each component in the ternary system formed by the solvent, non-solvent and polymer. As shown in figure 1, when the polymer solution is immersed in the coagulation bath of the non-solvent, the solvent and the non-solvent undergo diffusion exchange, the solvent leaves the polymer solution, and the non-solvent enters the polymer phase. At this time, the system composition changes, the solution passes through the binodal line and enters the two phases section, and phase separation occurs, that is, the polymer-rich phase appears as the membrane matrix, and the polymer-poor phase as the membrane pore structure. Therefore, if the diffusion rate is fast, the system quickly passes through the binodal and spinodal, and a porous or finger-like channel structure will be formed; if the diffusion rate is slow, a dense or sponge-like structure is easily formed. The specific microstructure determines the filtration performance of the membrane, such as flux and selectivity.

This experiment aims to prepare PES ultrafiltration membranes with different concentrations by phase inversion method and explore their effects on pure water flux.
## Methods
## 1. Membrane Preparation
In this experiment,commercial polyethersulfone (PES,UltrasonÂ® E 6020 P from BASF, molecular weight $= {51},{000}\mathrm{\;g}/\mathrm{{mol}}$ ) was used as the film raw material. $\mathrm{N},\mathrm{N}$ - Dimethylformamide (DMF, $\geq  {99}\%$ ,Sigma-Aldrich Australia) was used for dissolution. Two PES solutions with different concentrations (10 wt% and 15 wt%) were prepared. The dissolution process required continuous stirring for 5 hours and then allowed to stand until the average solution had no bubbles. A casting knife (Paul N. Gardner Co., Inc. USA) was used to scrape the two polymer solutions on a glass plate at room temperature with a gap of ${200}\mathrm{\;{um}}$ . Double deionized water was used as a nonsolvent for phase separation. After the film was completely detached from the glass plate, the film was removed from the coagulation bath and stored in deionized water for later use.

## 2. Pure Water Flux Measurement (PWF)
The prepared membranes were cut into cores with a diameter of ${49}\mathrm{\;{mm}}$ ,and the pure water flux of the membranes were tested using a Sterlitech HP4750 dead-end stirred cell (Sterlitech Corporation,USA). The pressure valve was controlled at ${100}\mathrm{{kPa}}$ and ${200}\mathrm{{kPa}}$ at room temperature for the two membranes. The permeate was collected using a digital balance (PA2102C, Ohaus).

The experiment was recorded according to Table 1. A stopwatch was used to record the time. For group A samples,the time was recorded every ${40}\mathrm{\;g}$ . For group B,the time was recorded every time the digital balance changed. The raw data recorded can be found in supplementary table 1. The equation (Sivakumar et al., 2006) used to calculate the pure water flux is:

$$
{J}_{w} = \frac{Q}{A\Delta t}
$$

Where: ${J}_{w}$ is pure water permeation flux $\left( {L \cdot  {m}^{-2} \cdot  {ba}{r}^{-1}}\right) ,\mathrm{Q}$ is quantity of permeate (L), $\mathrm{A}$ is effective membrane area $\left( {m}^{2}\right) ,{\Delta t}$ is sampling time (h).

> Table 2. Pure water flux for each membrane. A1 The samples in group A were 10 wt% (sample A1 had better surface flatness than sample A2); the sample in group B was 15 wt%.

For the two samples in group A, A1 with better surface flatness and A2 with obvious fine wrinkles that can be found by naked eyes are compared. The data points are reasonably dispersed, so the average value is taken directly. However, since the data collected by sample B does not have a constant value (the specific experimental data are in appendix supplementary table 1), as shown in the fitting diagram (Figure 2.). The main reasons for this phenomenon are:

1. The experimental time is too short, and the sample needs to be completely immersed at the beginning.
2. The sample is not immediately placed in deionized water after cutting, which may cause additional wrinkles and micro-morphology collapse.
3. Sample B is gradually compacted under 2 bar pressure conditions, and it takes a certain amount of time to stabilize.

Therefore, this paper uses exponential function fitting and extrapolation to obtain the water flux value of sample B. The fitting function is $y = 0.10256-0.23198 \cdot 0.98812^x$ , and the upper limit of this function 0.10256 is used as the water flux value of sample B $\left( {{0.10256L} \cdot  {m}^{-2} \cdot  {ba}{r}^{-1}}\right)$ .

> Figure 2. Pure water flux of sample B,red curve is exponential fitting (function is $y = 0.10256-0.23198 \cdot 0.98812^x$)

As shown in Table 2, the concentration of the PES polymer solution plays a key role in film preparation and directly affects the porosity and water flux of the membrane. PES membranes prepared with lower polymer concentrations usually result in greater porosity and higher water flux. The reason is that at low concentrations, the phase separation rate of the PES membrane is faster during the phase inversion process. In contrast, higher concentration PES membranes will produce a denser structure, reduce porosity, and thus reduce water flux. In addition, comparing the two samples in Group A, subtle surface defects will seriously affect the water flux of the membrane. Compared with the A1 sample, the A2 sample only retains 17.8% of the water flux.

For the removal of dye pollutants in sewage, assuming the actual operating pressure is 1 bar, the membrane area is 1 square meter, and the actual flux is 70% of the pure water flux. Then,for $\mathrm{A}1$ with a smooth surface, ${140}\mathrm{\;L}$ of dye-containing sewage can be treated per hour. For B,only ${100}\mathrm{\;{mL}}$ can be treated per hour,which is obviously not efficient enough for actual application scenarios. However, the extremely low pure water flux of Membrane B means better filtration effect. By adding pore-forming agents such as PEG for modification to increase porosity (Amirilargani et al., 2009), combined with interception experiments of different pollutant concentrations, dye pollutants in water can be better removed.


## Conclusion
In this experiment, two membranes with different concentrations of PES (10 wt% and 15 wt%) were successfully prepared. In the water flux test, it can be found that the higher the concentration of the polymer solution, the denser the membrane and the smaller the water flux. At the same time, surface defects will seriously affect the performance of the membrane. The higher the surface flatness, the better the membrane performance. For the removal of dye pollutants in water,directly using $\mathrm{A}\left( {{10}\mathrm{{wt}}\% }\right)$ is a better choice, and if the membrane can be optimized through modification technology, then membrane B (15 wt%) has better potential.
