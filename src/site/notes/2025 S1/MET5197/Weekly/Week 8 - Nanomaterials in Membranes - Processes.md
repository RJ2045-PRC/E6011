#### 1 What is osmotic pressure?
在渗透过程中，为了**阻止**溶剂（水）从低浓度的一侧流向高浓度的一侧所需要施加的**最小压力**。
Minimine Pressure to prevent sovent flow from low concentration side to high cenentration side.
#### 2 How does reverse osmosis work?
Using pressure as a Driven Force, to push High concentration solution flow through membrane, to obtaine low concnetration solution

#### 3 Describe the key **differences** between **solvent based** and **temperature based** phase inversion.
| 区别         | Solvent-based（溶剂诱导）            | Thermally-based （热诱导）  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **驱动方式**   | **溶剂与非溶剂之间的交换**导致聚合物沉淀         | **温度变化**改变聚合物的溶解性，导致析出 |
| **常见触发方式** | - 溶剂蒸发- 非溶剂沉淀（如水）- 气相诱导沉淀      | - 降温导致聚合物溶解度降低         |

#### 5 Describe three key differences between reverse osmosis and electrodialysis
| 区别                         | Reverse Osmosis（RO）      | Electrodialysis（ED）    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1. 驱动力（Driving Force）      | 大于渗透压的压力                 | 电势差                    |
| 2. 分离对象（What is separated） | 去除**所有溶解物**（包括盐、有机物、微生物） | 仅分离**带电离子**（Na⁺、Cl⁻ 等） |
| 3. 膜类型（Membrane Type）      | **半透膜**（阻止盐和溶质通过）        | **离子交换膜**（只让阳/阴离子分别通过） |
| 4. **能耗**                  | 高（因需大压力）                 | 低（电压驱动）                |
#### 6 Describe an application in Australia where pervaporation would be a sustinable and effective solution.



#### 7 Why is a lower driving force used for UF when compared to RO?
|             | Ultrafiltration (UF)         | Reverse Osmosis（RO）                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Application | Separation of Macromolecular | Sepaation of Salts and microsolutes |
| Pore Radius | 1-10 nm                      | 0.5 - 1.5 nm                        |


#### 8 You have developed a new separation process to isolate methylcyclohexane from toluene. This process is key for enabling liquid organic hydrogen carriers to move green hydrogen globally by using the existing petrochemical infrastructure. However, during the initial measurements, you notice the amount of toluene passing through the membrane rapidly increasing.
- What phenomenon is causing this? 
- What options are there to eliminate it?

**Swelling**: 高浓度渗透成分的吸附会导致膜的聚合物膨胀和塑化，从而影响渗透性能
方法：
- 加入 MOF 等刚性填料  
- 交联聚合物结构  
- 更稳定的膜材料选择

#### 9 Hospitals are often concerned about the transmission of viruses and bacteria from one part of the hospital to another through the local plumbing. They often used membranes to mitigate this risk. What type of membrane process would be best for this and why?
 Viruses and bacteria Size: 150-200 nm
 使用**UF**
 孔径匹配病毒/细菌尺寸、低能耗、结构简单、流量高、应用成熟

| 技术                      | 原因                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **RO（反渗透）**             | 过度，能耗高，重点是去除盐和小分子，成本不划算  |
| **NF（纳滤）**              | 可以去除部分病毒，但比 UF 更贵，处理流量较低 |
| **ED（电渗析）**             | 只能分离离子，**不能去除细菌或病毒**     |
| **Pervaporation / 气体膜** | 完全不适用于水中颗粒分离             |
#### 10 You are employed as a materials engineer at the Wonthaggi desalination plant. Shortly after you begin, you learn of complaints about the membrane performance. "**Not enough water gets through and it goes down over time**", you hear from frustrated colleagues.
  
- What well known membrane challenges might be causing this? 
- You want to quickly manufacture a new membrane material to test if you can improve the rate of water transport. Which method would you use, which polymer would you make, and how would you go about synthesising it?

#### 11 Fresh from your time at Monash, you decide to start your own company, MuskOff. At MuskOff, you decide to deal with the problem of **battery recycling**, which has begun as many of the Tesla fleet begin to age. As part of this, you have **dissolved the battery**, which contains nickel, cobalt, manganese and lithium. You wish to **separate the lithium from the other bigger and heavier elements.**
These metals are likely to result in **concentration polarisation** and **mineral scaling**. What would you do about this?

**concentration polarisation**
- Increasing turbulent flow at the surface 
- 3D printing
**mineral scaling**
- PH control
- Routine Maintainance
#### 12 One lunchtime you take a walk around campus and notice water weeping out of a water tank. The tank has been sitting out in the sun for many years.
- What material are water tanks made from? 
- What process might cause the water to be able to escape? 
- How might this be stopped in a new water tank that could be a manufactured replacement?

1. PE or HDPE
2. UV light, Chemical Aging
3. Cross-linking, remove reactive sites


#### 13 In your own words, research and describe the process developed by Electralith, and what advantages they may have over the market more generally.





#### 14 take a look at the company Membrane Technology and Research. What process are they offering to dry solvents? https://www.mtrinc.com/dehydration
