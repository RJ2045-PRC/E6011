#### 1 Explain how the **process of reverse osmosis** operates and **what kind of pressure** is typically required to treat **seawater**
1. Process: Overcome seawater osmosis pressure, press water through semi-permeable Membrane, reject the ions.
2. Pressure type: larger than osmosis pressure of seawater + more for higher water flux(40-80 bar, Seawater: 25-28 bar)
#### 2 Why do you think forward osmosis was not initially preferred for use in water purification?
- FO使用浓度梯度作为驱动力，利用特殊溶液浓度远高于海水浓度，得到Draw solution。
- 该过程Flux稳定，耗能较低
- FO得到的Draw Solution，需要后续加工得到纯水，然而这一步限制了FO的使用
#### 3 name three key **differences** between **reverse osmosis** and **nanofiltration**

| 特征          | **Reverse Osmosis (RO)**                | **Nanofiltration (NF)**                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. 分离能力** | 几乎**完全去除所有离子、分子、病毒、盐类**（>99% rejection） | 能**部分去除**单价离子，但更适用于**有机小分子和多价离子**（如Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺）的分离 |
| **2. 操作压力** | **更高压力**，典型为 **40–80 bar**（尤其在海水脱盐中）    | **中等压力**，通常为 **4–30 bar**                         |
| **3. 应用场景** | 用于**海水脱盐、纯水制备**等要求极高去除率的应用              | 用于**硬度调节、饮用水软化、抗生素浓缩**等应用，不要求完全除盐                 |
#### 4 Why would the **water to salt permeability ratio** improve in a **cellulose acetate** RO membrane as the **acetyl content increased**?
CA随着acetyl content increase增加，亲水性降低，选择性增强，脱盐率增加。

Acetyl content increased，意味着更**高的乙酰化**，分子**链更致密**，疏水性增加; 水的permeability增加，salt的permeability降低，ratio增加。
#### 5 How is acetylation typically achieved?

> Cellulose –OH + (CH₃CO)₂O  →  Cellulose –OCOCH₃ + CH₃COOH
> **Replacing -OH with -OCOCH3**
#### 6 Most RO membrane are **thin film composites**. Explain **why** and define the **purpose** of **each** of the **layers**.

1. PA, act as UF layer for slective
2. PSU or PES, support + water flux
3. PE, Structure Support
#### 7 Describe a process for **removing** a build up of **metal hydroxide residues** from a **liquid membrane surface**.
- Reversible: *Backwashing* or *Shear Force*
- Irreversible: *acid*/alkalis washing

#### 8 Describe a process for removing a build up of **bacteria** from a liquid membrane surface.
- Reversible: *Backwashing* or *Shear Force*
- Irreversible: NaOCl NaOH

#### 9 Why are **silver nanoparticles** pervasive within these kinds of membranes?

Ag⁺ 离子进入细胞，细菌死亡，抑制biofilm


#### 10 You are tasked with providing **ultrapure water** to the lab in the New Horizons building. Because of the nature of the build, the **copper pipes** have been known to be slowly oxidising into the water stream. Because of sustainability goals, you are seeking to achioeve this with the lowest possibnle energy use. Describe the materials and process you would use, and why.
UF [[#3 name three key **differences** between **reverse osmosis** and **nanofiltration**|Q3]]

#### 11 take a look at the provided paper entitled 'week 10 reading', and at your tables as a group, answer the following questions:
1. What are three accepted mechanisms of separation of critical mineral ions from brine solutions? 
2. Why is it more technically important to achieve separation of lithium from magneisum and not from the far more abundant magnesium? 
3. How does a crown ether material achieve a separation in this field? 
4. What is a MOF and how is it used within a lithium purification membrane? 
5. In your team's opinion, what are the most promising set of materials, as shown in figure 16?
