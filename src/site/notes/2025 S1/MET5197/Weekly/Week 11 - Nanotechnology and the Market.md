> To evaluate a tech from concept to practical use.
- 1-2: Concept
- 3-7: Lab validation
- 8-9: Practical

#### 2 Define the term commercial readiness index and how it might at times compete against the TRL.
A measurement to evaluate the commercial availability of a tech, not focus on the tech, more prefer on the market. Supply chain, FDA, Scale up.

#### 3 Search for an example of a technology that either (a) was not the best option but found commercial success or (b) was the best technical option and did not find commercial success


#### 4 What was the actual timeline for the development of new covid vaccines?

#### 7 You have a role at Dow Chemical as a materials engineer tasked with the development of a **new gas separation membrane**. The membrane has been publicised as a potential new market for the comnpany. After some work you discover that the membrane cannot be used for the claimed activity. Is it OK to keep this finding secret? Why?



#### 8 Take a look at the membrane Copmany Aquaporin: https://aquaporin.com 
1. What is the nanoparticle being used in their membranes and how does it work? 
2. What is their target market? 
3. Are there any environmental or ethical concerns? 
4. Are there any possible Dual Use of Technology concerns with this technology? 
5. What was the timeline from discovery to product?


#### 9 take a look at the company nanoh2O http://www.nanoh2o.com/ and consider the same questions. What is different about this company?
#### 10 Each table will choose one of these Australian nanotechnology companies and research the following questions to share with the group: 
1.Imugene 2. Kite Magnetics 3. Electralith 4. CSL 5. Nematiq 
- what is the nanotechnology within their product? 
- who is their target market? 
- what TRL do you think the compan is at? 
- what risks do you foresee?


#### 11 You have recently joined Membrane Technology and Research (MTR) as a process engineer. Your team is tasked with designing a membrane-based gas separation unit to recover CO₂ from a natural gas stream (**CO₂/CH₄ separation)** at an offshore processing facility.
MTR offers a range of polymer membranes, including cellulose acetate, polyimides, and perfluoropolymers, with different performance profiles and module types (e.g., spiral wound, hollow fibre, plate-and-frame). 

As part of the design team, you must make key decisions regarding: 
- Based on performance and environmental considerations, **which polymer** would be most appropriate? 
- Which **module type** would be most suitable for this offshore installation? Justify your choice in terms of **packing density,** **ease of replacement**, and **mechanical robustness**. 
- Stage cut: **Define** what is meant by stage cut in membrane separations. Would you recommend a high or low stage cut for this application, and why? 
- What strategies could be implemented to manage or reduce membrane fouling from impurities in the natural gas stream?

| 材料                    | 性能                   | 环境影响            | 说明                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Cellulose Acetate** | 中等选择性、便宜、适合温和条件      | 可生物降解，但对温度和湿度敏感 | 通常用于陆地应用，稳定性有限           |
| **Polyimide** ✅       | **高选择性和渗透性兼具**，耐温，耐压 | 可商业批量合成，性能可调控   | 是目前工业上用于 CO₂/CH₄ 分离的主流材料 |
| Perfluoropolymers     | 化学稳定性极高，但渗透率低        | 高成本，生产碳足迹大      | 常用于腐蚀环境，不适合高通量要求场合       |

|模块类型|优点|缺点|适合性评价|
|---|---|---|---|
|**中空纤维 Hollow Fibre** ✅|**高填装密度（packing density）**，自支撑结构，抗压强|零部件更紧凑但维修困难|✔ 极适合空间有限的**海上平台**|
|Spiral Wound|成本低，制造成熟|易受污染，不耐高压|✘ 空间与压力限制下不优选|
|Plate and Frame|易于清洗与更换|占地大，填装密度低|✘ 不适合海上紧凑安装|

$$
Stage \ Cut = \frac {Q_{p}}{Q_{f}}

#### 12 You have just started working as a membrane process engineer at a coastal reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant that has been offline for six months due to maintenance and seasonal shutdown. Your task is to oversee the recommissioning of the membrane system and ensure reliable drinking water production. 
As part of this process, you must make key decisions regarding membrane setup and system operation: 
- What characteristics should the selected polymer membrane possess for seawater desalination? 
- Choose an appropriate membrane module type and layout (e.g., single-stage versus multiple stage). Explain your reasoning in terms of performance, footprint, and energy efficiency. 
- What measures would you implement to minimise biofouling during operation, and how might membrane cleaning be scheduled?
#### 13 You are working in Matt's lab and decide you want to develop a polymeric **microfiltration membrane** for use in a food processing application (e.g., **removing bacteria from milk**). You are asked to fabricate membranes using different phase inversion techniques, including:
1. Non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) 
2. Thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) 
3. Evaporation induced phase separation (EIPS) 

- Briefly describe how you would cast a membrane using each of the three methods above. Include key steps and conditions for each technique. 
- Compare and contrast the expected morphology, pore size, and mechanical properties of the resulting membranes. Which method would you choose for producing a microfiltration membrane and why?

|特征项|NIPS|TIPS|EIPS|
|---|---|---|---|
|**相分离驱动**|非溶剂扩散|温度冷却|溶剂挥发|
|**膜结构**|非对称（皮层+支撑层）|对称、均一|对称但结构致密|
|**孔径范围**|0.01 – 1 μm（可控）|0.1 – 1 μm（适用于微滤）|< 0.1 μm（更像超滤）|
|**力学强度**|中等|**高**|较低|
|**可控性/重现性**|易受操作条件影响|稳定、高可控|对挥发环境敏感|
|**适用场景**|超滤、微滤、废水处理等|**食品微滤、工业过滤、血液过滤**|高性能表面膜、气体分离薄膜等|
