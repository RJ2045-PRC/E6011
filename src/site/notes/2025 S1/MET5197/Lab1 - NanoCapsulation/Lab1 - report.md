## Abstract
The low solubility of anticancer drugs limits their therapeutic efficacy. In this study, Pluronics F127 micelles were prepared using solvent evaporation and thin-film hydration techniques, and curcumin was successfully loaded into the nanoparticles. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to characterize the particle size and polydispersity, confirming the successful formation of uniform, spherical micelles. The size decreased from 429 nm for pure CUR aggregates to 23–33 nm for the nanoparticles, while the polydispersity index (PDI) was reduced from 0.491 to as low as 0.05, achieving a highly monodisperse nanoparticle system. UV-Vis spectroscopy was used to quantify the drug loading (DL = 1.47 mg) and encapsulation efficiency (EE = 49.16%). Optimization strategies, such as chemical functionalization and process refinement, were also discussed. This study demonstrates that Pluronics F127-based micelles can effectively improve the solubility of hydrophobic drugs and enhance the reliability of drug delivery.
## Introduction

Fig.1 Pluronic block copolymer molecule (A) and micelle with a solubilized drug (B). (Batrakova & Kabanov, 2008)

Fig.1 illustrates the structure of the Pluronic block copolymer and how it self-assembles into micelles for drug loading. The self-assembly of the block copolymer typically occurs when the concentration exceeds the critical micelle concentration (CMC), which is 0.034 mg/mL for PF127. Researchers (Batrakova & Kabanov, 2008; Savic et al., 2003) have noted that, since biological membranes are composed of phospholipid bilayers, the amphiphilic nature of Pluronics allows them to insert into the membrane, affecting its fluidity and permeability. Once embedded, Pluronics can further enter cells through mechanisms such as endocytosis and diffusion, and interact with various intracellular structures, making them highly effective for targeted drug delivery.

For example, Suk et al. (2007) successfully developed an efficient oral drug delivery system by loading the poorly soluble drug genistein into micelles formed by Pluronic F127. Similarly, Valle et al. (2004) studied SP1049C, the first clinical micellar formulation for cancer therapy, in which doxorubicin (Dox) was loaded into mixed micelles of Pluronic L61 and F127. This system achieved higher peak concentrations and longer retention times at tumor sites compared to free Dox. These studies demonstrate that Pluronic F127 can be used to develop highly effective drug delivery systems.

Diferuloylmethane, also known as curcumin (CUR), is the main active component of turmeric. In addition to its applications in the food industry, its antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-rheumatic properties make it equally important in the pharmaceutical field, and it has been pharmaceutically certified for safety (Kharat et al., 2017; Anirudhan et al., 2021).Tønnesen and Karlsen (1985) pointed out that curcumin (CUR) undergoes rapid hydrolysis in aqueous solutions, requiring acidic conditions to maintain formulation stability. However, the poor solubility under acidic conditions (approximately 10^−5 mg/mL) and molecular instability under alkaline conditions present a major challenge, severely limiting the practical application of CUR.

Due to the poor solubility of CUR under mildly acidic conditions and its hydrophobic nature, researchers (Sheikh et al., 2022) have attempted to combine CUR with the surfactant Pluronic F-127. By encapsulating CUR within the hydrophobic core of PF127 micelles, they formed NanoCUR to achieve efficient drug delivery and encapsulation, thereby enhancing the long-term retention of the drug in the body.

To better understand the drug delivery performance of NanoCUR, this study employed the evaporative solvent method, using thin-film self-assembly to load CUR into PF127 nanoparticles in an aqueous solution. To characterize the process, dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to measure particle size and analyze aggregation behavior at each step, while UV-Vis spectroscopy was used to assess the final drug loading, verifying the effectiveness of PF127 polymer micelles in delivering hydrophobic drugs.
## Materials and Methods
### **_Nanoparticle preparation_**

Nanoparticles were prepared using a thin film hydration method. The control group consisted of 3 mg of CUR, while the experimental group consisted of triplicate batches containing 3 mg of curcumin and 30 mg of PF127. The powders were first dissolved in 0.5 mL of ethanol, followed by solvent evaporation under a nitrogen atmosphere to form a thin film. The film was then rehydrated with 3 mL of deionized water to dissolve the sample, allowing PF127 to self-assemble in the aqueous solution and encapsulate CUR in experimental groups. To ensure thorough mixing and dissolution, all mixing steps were performed using a vortex mixer (from Westla). After complete dissolution, the samples were filtered through a 0.45 µm filter (from AGILENT) and transferred into glass vials for followed use.

### **_Dynamic_** **_Light Scattering (DLS)_**

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was primarily used to measure the hydrodynamic size and polydispersity index (PDI) of the samples. In this study, a Zetasizer DLS analyzer (from AGILENT) was used to characterize the samples, assessing particle size and aggregation behavior within the system. Prepared samples were transferred into DLS cuvettes using a pipette. Triplicate measurements were performed for the control group (1 batch) and the experimental groups (3 batches). Both number distribution and intensity distribution data were recorded, and the results were further analyzed using correlograms.

### **_UV-Vis_** **_spectrometer_**

To quantify the encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading of CUR in PF127 nanoparticles, a calibration curve was established by preparing a series of CUR dilutions in an ethanol/water mixture. UV-Vis spectroscopy was used to record absorbance between 300 and 500 nm. Based on the calibration curve, the CUR loading and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the prepared samples were analyzed. EE was calculated using the following formula:
$$EE \ (\%) =\frac{Weight \ of \ encapsulated \ Drug }{Weight \ of \ total \ added \ Drug} \times 100\% $$
## Results & Discussion

Table 1 Calculation for making micelles

In this study, samples were prepared according to the data shown in Table 1. To ensure that PF127 could self-assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous solution, the final concentration after dissolution was designed to be 10 mg/mL, which is well above the CMC of PF127 and sufficient to promote self-assembly. If only 0.03 mg of PF127 were added, the concentration would not reach the CMC, and stable micelle formation would not occur.
### DLS Analysis
![Pasted image 20250426225232.png](/img/user/Attachments/ScreenShot/Pasted%20image%2020250426225232.png)
Table 2 DLS data. Control group: CUR + Water, samples: CUR + PF 127 + water.

DLS data were collected and summarized in Table 2. Due to the extremely low solubility of CUR, the control group samples exhibited significant aggregation, with a Z-average diameter of 429.3 nm and a high PDI of 0.491, indicating poor dispersion. In contrast, the experimental group samples showed a Z-average diameter of 23–33 nm, and their lower PDI values (0.05–0.281) indicated that the prepared samples were monodisperse, with no aggregation, and within the typical size range (Elsevier, 2004) of spherical micelles (10–30 nm).

Furthermore, in all samples, the particle size determined by intensity distribution was notably larger than that determined by number distribution. This is mainly because, in DLS measurements, the scattered light intensity is proportional to the sixth power of the particle diameter. As a result, a small number of large particles in the solution can contribute disproportionately to the intensity signal, causing the intensity distribution to skew toward larger sizes.

Moreover, DLS alone cannot provide information on the morphology or internal structure of nanoparticles. It only offers insights into size distribution and uniformity. Additionally, the size measured by DLS represents the hydrodynamic diameter, which is often larger than the actual particle size. To better investigate the morphology of nanoparticles, techniques such as TEM or FE-SEM can be used for direct observation, allowing confirmation of the self-assembled nanoparticle structure and aggregation state.

Fig.2 Correlogram of 4 samples. A) control group; B – D) Sample 1 - 3

Based on Fig. 2, it can be observed that the autocorrelation function curve of the control group shows poor fitting in the later stage, indicating the presence of larger particles or a secondary particle population. This observation is consistent with the DLS size measurements and further confirms that CUR has difficulty forming a well-dispersed system in aqueous conditions. In contrast, the ASF curves of the experimental group samples fit well, supporting the data in Table 2 and confirming that the experimental samples are uniformly dispersed spherical micelles.

### UV-Vis Analysis
To evaluate the encapsulation efficiency of CUR by PF127 and further verify its drug-loading capability in drug delivery, UV-Vis analysis was performed on the diluted samples. Before measuring the actual samples, a calibration curve was established by recording the absorbance of CUR at known concentrations and applying linear fitting. This step was taken to account for factors such as instrument response and the actual molar extinction coefficient (ε) in the solvent system. To ensure consistency with the sample conditions, the dispersant used for the calibration experiment was 100 µL of water mixed with 2.9 mL of ethanol. Fig. 3 shows the fitted calibration curve for CUR before formal measurements, and the final fitting equation was:
$$A (absorbance) = -0.04705 + 181.669 \times C (concentration)$$

Fig. 4 UV-Vis of 4 samples

As shown in Fig. 4, the UV-Vis spectrum indicates that the absorbance of the control group sample was negligible, with no background noise interference. The main absorption peak of CUR appeared at 425–430 nm. In the experimental group samples, particularly in sample 3, a distinct abnormal peak was observed around 390 nm, which is attributed to light scattering caused by aggregated CUR particles. Combined with the DLS result showing a PDI of 0.05, this suggests that there may have been errors in the DLS measurement or that impurities were introduced during sample transfer into the UV-Vis cuvette. To address such issues, additional filtration, ultrasonic treatment, and repeated DLS measurements can be employed to improve sample uniformity and validate the accuracy of the data.

Table 3 Calculation of EE and DL

Based on the UV-Vis measurements, the encapsulation efficiency of PF127 was analyzed. The specific data are summarized in Table 3, showing a final drug loading (DL) of 1.47 mg and an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 49.16%.

To improve drug loading (DL) and encapsulation efficiency (EE), the following optimizations could be considered as an extension of this study:

1. Adjusting the formulation ratio:

Using a trial-and-error approach, an orthogonal experimental design can be established to identify the optimal PF127-to-CUR ratio that achieves the highest DL and EE.

2. Optimizing the experimental process：

In this study, two separate thin films were prepared and then dispersed in water to promote PF127 self-assembly. However, due to the poor solubility of CUR in water, the resulting thin films were difficult to distribute evenly, and partial re-aggregation occurred after drying. Additionally, during the vortex mixing step, some CUR adhered to the glass vial stopper, leading to incomplete dispersion and reduced actual drug loading during the subsequent formation of NanoCUR.

Optimization strategies include applying ultrasonic treatment during both the initial dissolution and the rehydration steps, with extended processing times, and ensuring sufficient drying time during solvent evaporation to achieve complete dehydration.

3. Surface modification of PF 127

As demonstrated by Anirudhan et al. (2021), terminal modification of PF127 can be performed by oxidizing the hydroxyl groups to aldehyde groups, producing PF–CHO. Mixed micelles prepared from PF–CHO and FA-PP have been shown to improve DL and EE.

## Conclusion
In summary, PF127 micelles successfully encapsulated the hydrophobic drug CUR, leading to improvements in solubility and dispersibility. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis confirmed the formation of nanosized micelles (23–33 nm) with a stable, monodisperse system. UV-Vis spectroscopy further demonstrated that 1.47 mg of CUR was successfully loaded into the prepared micelles, achieving an encapsulation efficiency of 49.16%.

Although a certain level of drug loading was achieved, there is still room for improvement in encapsulation efficiency in future studies. Enhancing the experimental process—such as applying chemical modifications to PF127, extending and using ultrasonic treatment during dispersion, and improving the drying process—could further increase DL and EE.

Overall, PF127 micelles show great promise as a delivery system for poorly soluble anticancer drugs.
