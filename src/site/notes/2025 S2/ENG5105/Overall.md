## Task Info
### OBJ
1. Design a tertiary treatment subsystem that includes membrane technology and improves water quality to meet Victorian EPA recycled water standards for **Class A** recycled water.
2. Show **how** the **subsystem** can be **integrated** with existing treatment processes.
3. **Evaluate** both ***conventional*** and ***advanced membrane* materials** for **performance** and **sustainability**.
### Key activities will include:
● **Evaluate process and materials options for a membrane subsystem**
● Justify final design choices based on **performance**, **cost**, **economical** and **environmental impacts**.
● Developing **process flow diagrams** and **conducting mass** and **energy balances** for the membrane subsystem.
● **Selecting** and sizing preliminary equipment suitable for the membrane subsystem.
● Designing the subsystem integration with upstream secondary treatment processes.
● Evaluating **environmental** and **economic** considerations of the subsystem.
● Conducting **membrane performance analysis** (e.g. flow cell tests, Monash Pilot Plant.6) and **materials characterisation** (e.g. SEM, FTIR, DSC) on real membranes using analytical techniques
● Completing a **life cycle assessment (LCA)** comparing conventional and advanced membrane materials.
