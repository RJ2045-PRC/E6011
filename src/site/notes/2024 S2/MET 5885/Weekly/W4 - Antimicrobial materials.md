## General
Infections caused by implantation of medical devices are a significant problem. This week, we will investigate the causes and challenges of this and investigate approaches that can be used to prepare antibacterial materials.
## Weekly objectives
 1. To recognise the fundamental properties of bacteria, fungi and biofilms and describe how/why this makes them a problem for biomedical implants

2. To describe the main strategies that can be used to prevent infection of biomedical devices

3. To analyse antimicrobial materials to show how their properties have an antimicrobial effect

4. To discuss the clinical significance of typical strategies





## Pre-class

### 1. **Causes** of infections
>[!tip] [[Antimicrobial materials_intro slides.pdf#page=8&selection=2,2,2,10|Bacteria]], [[Antimicrobial materials_intro slides.pdf#page=9&selection=2,2,2,29|Fungi]], [[Antimicrobial materials_intro slides.pdf#page=10&selection=0,0,0,8|Biofilms]]
#### 1.1 Bacteria
- **Classification**: Prokaryotes (simple, single-cell organisms)
- **DNA**: Floats freely in a nucleoid (unlike eukaryotic cells where DNA is in a nucleus)
- **Role**: Can be both beneficial and harmful to human health
- **Associated with Infections**: Especially in hospitals (Hospital Acquired Infections - HIAs)
    - Key bacteria: _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Staphylococcus epidermidis_, _Enterococcus faecalis_, _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Proteus mirabilis_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_
#### 1.2 Fungi (Particularly Yeast)
- **Classification**: Eukaryotes, single-celled microorganisms in the fungus kingdom
- **Common Cause**: _Candida albicans_ is the most common cause of fungal infections, responsible for most bloodstream infections
- **Habitat**: Found on skin, in the gastrointestinal tract, and other localized areas
- **Dimorphism**: _Candida albicans_ can grow as yeast and filamentous cells
- **Biofilm Protection**: Can form biofilms that protect against antibiotics and antifungal drugs
#### 1.3 Biofilms
- **Composition**: Mixture of microorganisms within a slimy matrix
- **Structure**: Organized surface structures with distinct architecture
- **Function**: Provides a protected microenvironment, making bacteria and fungi hard to treat
- **Impact**: Responsible for ~80% of all hospital-acquired infections (HIAs)

### 2. Anti-infection **strategies**
>[!tip] 
>1. Prevent infection: prevent attachment of bacteria and fungi
>2. Combat infection: kill bacteria and fungi


>[!tip] Materials-based strategies:
>- Passivating coatings
>- Topographies
>- Release of bioactives
>- Coatings with antimicrobial properties

2.1 Strategy 1 Polymer coatings to prevent attachment
2.2 Strategy 2 a Topographies that **prevent** attachment
2.3 Strategy 2 b Topographies that **kill** bacteria on attachment
2.4 Strategy 3 Release of bioactives
