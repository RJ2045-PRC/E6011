## Lecture


## Post-class

We used tensegrity models to understand why cells have different shapes and structures on biomaterials with different properties. 

Check out our stormboard for some more notes

The key messages from me are:

**Cell mechanics:**

- that we can use tensegrity to understand cell mechanics. The straws represent microtubules that resist compression and the elastic bands represent actin filaments that generate tension. Tension can be generated either by spreading of the cell (imaging stretching the elastic band) or by the contractile forces generated by myosin.

- the system is flexible, responsive, resilient, dynamic and globally integrated. Two key features are that it is **pre-stressed** (meaning that a cell will pull against any substrate it attaches to) and moves towards **equilibrium** (this is why cell shape changes on different biomaterials- the structure of the cell will remodel until this equilibrium is achieved).

**Mechanotransduction**

- the way a physical cue is converted into a biochemical signal. WE discussed TWO key mechanisms, both linked to the unfolding of proteins to 1) change the activity of that protein (e.g. an enzyme) or 2) to alter the other proteins that it binds to (e.g. changing the composition of proteins in a focal adhesion).

**Application to biomaterials**

- we saw this in the example of cell morphology on the soft/stiff and high/low creep biomaterials. The stiff biomaterial can withstand higher forces before being deformed - this means that the cell can be in a conformation that applies high levels of tension. Typically this means that the cell can spread more to become larger and that actin bundles are thicker and more aligned. The soft gels are deformed easily so can withstand less tension- cells on these substrates will tend to be smaller, have thinner and less organised actin bundles. 

- response to different biomaterials. Both metals and hydrogels are being developed for bone repair. Think about the differences in the way these products are intended to be used and how this links to the properties of the material chosen.
