## Weekly objectives
### 1. Describe the processes that occur when biomaterials are implanted into the body

>[!tips]-  [[Mechanisms of biocompatibility.pdf#page=3&selection=0,0,0,45|Summary of events after implantation]]
>- **Immediate Response**: Rapid adsorption of nonspecific serum proteins onto the biomaterial surface.
>立即响应：非特异性血清蛋白快速吸附到生物材料表面。
>- **Pro-inflammatory Phase**: Recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes, differentiation into M1 macrophages, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
>促炎阶段：中性粒细胞和单核细胞的募集，分化为M1巨噬细胞，以及促炎细胞因子的分泌。
>- **Anti-inflammatory Phase**: Transition of macrophages to the M2 phenotype, promoting tissue repair and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
>抗炎阶段：巨噬细胞向M2表型转变，促进组织修复和抗炎细胞因子的分泌。
>- **Foreign Body Response**: Fusion of macrophages into giant cells to handle larger particles and persistent biomaterials.
>异物反应：巨噬细胞融合成巨细胞以处理较大的颗粒和持久性生物材料。
>- **Fibrous Encapsulation**: Formation of a fibrous capsule by fibroblasts around the biomaterial, isolating it from the surrounding tissue and marking the end of the chronic inflammatory response.
>纤维包裹：生物材料周围的成纤维细胞形成纤维囊，将其与周围组织隔离，标志着慢性炎症反应的结束。

| Phase                | Time             | Cellular Response        | Description                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Acute Inflammation   | Minutes to Hours | Neutrophils              | Rapid initial response to injury or implantation, peaks early and declines quickly.        |
| Chronic Inflammation | Hours to Days    | Macrophages              | Cleanup and healing phase, macrophages persist longer to deal with prolonged inflammation. |
| Chronic Inflammation | Days to Weeks    | Neovascularization       | Formation of new blood vessels to restore blood supply to the affected area.               |
| Chronic Inflammation | Days to Weeks    | Foreign Body Giant Cells | Formation of larger cells by macrophage fusion to attempt to engulf the foreign material.  |
| Granulation Tissue   | Days to Weeks    | Fibroblasts              | Involved in the formation of new connective tissue, critical for wound healing.            |
| Granulation Tissue   | Weeks to Months  | Fibrosis                 | Thickening and scarring of connective tissue, body isolates the foreign material.          |
| Chronic Inflammation | Weeks to Months  | Mononuclear Leukocytes   | Persistent immune response involving different types of white blood cells.                 |

#### Summary

1. **Acute Inflammation**: Neutrophils respond rapidly within minutes to hours to address the injury or implanted material, with a peak response that declines quickly.
2. **Chronic Inflammation**: Over hours to days, macrophages take over to continue cleanup and initiate healing. This stage includes neovascularization (new blood vessel formation) and the formation of foreign body giant cells (fused macrophages) to handle larger foreign materials.
3. **Granulation Tissue Formation**: From days to weeks, fibroblasts play a crucial role in forming new connective tissue, essential for wound healing.
4. **Fibrosis**: Over weeks to months, connective tissue thickens and scars, isolating the foreign material.
5. **Chronic Inflammation with Mononuclear Leukocytes**: Persistent immune response involving various white blood cells continues over weeks to months to address and repair affected tissue areas.

#### Provide an example of local and systemic effects that a biomaterial can have on the body

#### Explain the role of neutrophils and macrophages during the inflammation phase 
>Phagocytosis – clean the wound by clearing debris, dead cells, bactieria 
#### Why do foreign body giant cells form?

## Weekly wrap-up

- the foreign body response is initiated by **protein adsorption** and ends in **encapsulation** of the biomaterial in collagen. Strategies to prevent this include **stealth materials** that resist protein adsorption.  
>异物反应由蛋白质吸附引发，并以生物材料封装在胶原蛋白中结束。防止这种情况的策略包括抵抗蛋白质吸附的隐形材料。

- that biocompatibility is **context dependent**. If we take the David Williams definition of biocompatibility, this states that it is a function of the biomaterial, host and application. So what fulfils this criteria for one application may not be the same for another.   
>生物相容性取决于环境。如果我们采用大卫·威廉姆斯对生物相容性的定义，这表明它是生物材料、宿主和应用的函数。因此，一个应用程序满足此标准的内容可能与另一个应用程序不同。

- we also considered whether **encapsulation** following a foreign body response is a sufficient means to class something as biocompatible. We have moved on from the "old days" and  encapsulation certainly doesn't guarantee a biomaterial meets all of the other criteria of biocompatibility, and in many cases may interfere with the intended function of the product.  
>我们还考虑了异物反应后的封装是否足以将某些东西归类为生物相容性。我们已经摆脱了“旧时代”，封装当然不能保证生物材料满足所有其他生物相容性标准，并且在许多情况下可能会干扰产品的预期功能。
