---


## General
- Identify wastes ( **TIMWOOD** )
- **3 Ms (Muda, Mura, Muri)**
- Value Stream Mapping
## Weekly objectives
- Understand what is the waste
- Be able to differentiate different types of waste
- Be able to come up with the solution when a specific type of waste is identified
- Understand 3Ms in lean
- Be able to describe the relationship between them
- Understand the basic steps to create a Value Stream Map
- Be able to apply Value Stream Map to analyse the manufacturing process/flow and identify the waste or non-value-added time

## Pre-class

Try to identify what types of wastes do you see in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng2FvK5v6-U) and what did Tim do to get rid of those wastes?
>[!tip]- **Ans**:
>1. **Excess transportation** 
Waste: Tim shopped according to the alphabetical order of his list, causing him to run back and forth in the supermarket, wasting a lot of time and energy.
Measure: He organized his shopping list by different sections of the store, reducing unnecessary movement.
>1. **Inventory** 
W: Tim bought many extra tomatoes because he didn’t know how many were needed for the Italian sauce.
M: He learned that only three tomatoes are needed for the sauce
>1. **Motion** 
W: Using a handheld shopping basket at first, this caused the larger milk carton to not fit, so it was re-routed to the starting point and switched to a shopping cart, adding an extra move
M: He chose a shopping cart from the beginning, making it easier to move around and reducing excess motion
>1. **People** 
W: Frequent running around exhausted Tim
M: By optimizing his shopping process, Tim reduced physical exhaustion and increased overall shopping efficiency.
>1. **Waiting** 
W: Tim waited a long time at the deli counter for his order to be prepared, wasting time.
M: Tim pre-ordered items from the deli counter and completes other shopping events at the same time, minimizing wait times
>1. **Over producing** 
Not recognized
>1. **Over processing** 
Not recognized
>1. **Defects**
W: Tim mistakenly bought whole milk instead of the desired type because he didn’t check the label carefully, leading to the need to return and exchange the product
M: In his second shopping trip, he didn't buy milk, which solved the problem of buying the wrong milk from the Beginning

## Lecture
### Definition
Lean manufacturing also known as lean production is a methodology that focuses on **minimizing waste** within **manufacturing systems** while **simultaneously maximizing productivity**

>	- Unnecessary movement of materials or goods within a process
>- [[Week2_Identification_Waste_2023.pdf#page=15&selection=0,0,0,14|Inventory]]
>	- Excess inventory, including raw materials, WIP, or finished goods, that exceeds immediate production needs.

>	- Unnecessary movement by people or machines within a process.

>	- Idle time when people or machines are waiting for the completion of a process.
>-  [[Week2_Identification_Waste_2023.pdf#page=22&selection=0,0,2,10|Over-processing]]
>	- Performing more work or using more resources than necessary to meet customer requirements.
>-  [[Week2_Identification_Waste_2023.pdf#page=24&selection=0,0,0,14|Overproduction]]
>	- Producing more than is needed or faster than required by customer demand.

>	- Producing products that do not meet quality standards, leading to rework or scrap

>[!tip]- 3 Ms (MURA, MURI, MUDA)
>
>- MURA (inconsistency): uneven, irregular, erratic, inconsistent
>>Coming form:
>>- uneven customer demand
>>- uneven distribution of work load
>>- inconsistent quality of supplies and tools
>>- irregular scheduling of work
>>-result:
>>- **Effort to overcome Mura = Muri (overburden)**
>>- **Periods of low activity = Muda (waste)**
>- MURI (overburden): unreasonable, impossible, excessive
>>- People working too fast or hard to keep up with demand
>>- People working long hours to **make up** for lost time
>>- Running machines too fast to meet production targets
>>- Overloading machines to get more from them
>>- Skipping maintenance to reduce downtime
>- MUDA (waste): futile, useless, pointless

>>**Any activity that does't produce value for the customer**
